## 1. Add DB to the project

Those figure are created from a database in python (pandas). You need to recreate the database to the specific needs of Django. I think it's SQLight.

## 2. Create dynamic figure

Recreate the figure for :

- PCA Distribution
- Descriptor Variance

## 3. Create interactive and dynamic figure

For the Cluster by PCA figure, as you can see there is a possible user action to add data to display in the graph.

### a. Create the figure without user added data

### b. Create the figure integrating user added data


# **Fourth Objective**

Make the disign of the CACT matching the disign of all the website

- Font

# **Fifth Objective**

Restrict acces to the "CACT" menu.
